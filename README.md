# MERN-project
This project is a shipping and manning database app. It will have CRUD capabilities for the following objects: Operatives, Vessels, Vessel Visits. It will also be able to compute manning levels, and allows reporting for combination queries.

I have chosen to use the MERN stack as it is a popular method for creating web based projects with JavaScript.

My goals for the app are:

1) Ability to CRUD operatives, vessels and vessel visits
2) Search vessel visits and come up with a most common berth position
3) Create reports of hours worked within timeframes and rest periods
4) Input the expected shipping over the next day or week, and come up with a viable rest plan for each operative
5) App should be able to report manning levels for each visit
6) App should be able to man jobs using the current shift staff

My ideas for the next stage of the app would be to:

1) Automatically contact staff to muster them for jobs
2) Offer out work to available ad-hoc workers, accept their response and then man jobs fairly based on responses
3) Weigh jobs by difficulty or inconvenience to improve fairness with sharing out jobs
4) Remind staff that they are due to renew tickets (i.e. their medical etc)
5) Add word document of berth positions and the app strips out ther pertinent information, adding to database
